Assignment 3: Search for Treasure using the Best-First Search

Objective: Use Best-First Search to find a treasure in a grid.

Problem Statement: The treasure is hidden in a grid, and each cell has a heuristic value representing its "closeness" to the treasure. Implement Best-First Search to locate the treasure.

Tasks:

-Use Manhattan distance as a heuristic.

-Implement the algorithm to always move to the most promising cell first (minimum heuristic value).

-Analyze how heuristic choice affects performance.
